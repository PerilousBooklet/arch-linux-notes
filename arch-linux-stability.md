# Arch Linux Stability Guide
1. Use an LTS kernel:
2. Read [this][1] and [this][2] before updating.
3. Do not install out-of-date packages (?)
4. Use a downgrade program (es. `downgrade` from the AUR):
5. Avoid notoriously buggy software.
6. Use open source video drivers when possible.
7. Use secure and reliable mirror providers (https connection, good reputation)
8. Do not use bootloaders, use [unified kernel images][3] instead.
